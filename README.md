# TCP Server in C#

This is a TCP Server program written in C# using async and await features, which enables it to support over 10,000 TCP client connections. The project was developed using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition and targets the .NET Framework 4.8. However, it can run on any machine with a .NET Framework version higher than 4.0.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Programming:** The server utilizes asynchronous programming techniques like async and await to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
- **High Performance:** The design of the server prioritizes performance and scalability, allowing it to handle a large number of concurrent client connections efficiently.
- **Extensibility:** The server's architecture is designed to be extensible, making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones.

## Usage
